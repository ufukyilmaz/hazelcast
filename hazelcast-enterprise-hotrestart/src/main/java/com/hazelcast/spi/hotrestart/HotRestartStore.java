/**
 * Persistent store of key-value mappings specifically tailored to support
 * the Hot Restart feature. Supports only update operations and no data lookup.
 * Data retrieval happens only during the hot restart procedure, when this
 * store pushes data to its associated RAM stores.
 * <p>
 * Update operations (put/remove/clear) accept a "needs fsync" parameter which determines
 * the persistence semantics of the operation (immediate vs. eventual). For each given key
 * prefix the value of this parameter must always be the same because the Hot Restart Store
 * will group a batch of operations by the "needs fsync" value. Order within each group is
 * preserved.

 * The tracker may also refer to a key handle with no live record, if its global garbage count
 * is still non-zero. This condition can occur when the record is interred by a prefix tombstone.
 * <p>
 * The global garbage count is the number of all garbage records with the given key handle still
 * present in value chunks, excluding those records which are known to be interred by a prefix tombstone.
 * This count reaching zero means that, if the currently live record is a tombstone, it can be declared
 * garbage since there are no more records left that it must protect from resurrection.

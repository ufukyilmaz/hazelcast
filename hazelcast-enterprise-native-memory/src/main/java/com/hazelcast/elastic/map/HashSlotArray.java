/**
 * <p>A hashtable which keeps densely packed (key, value) entries in a native memory block.
 * As a consequence, both key and value have fixed size. The key may be up to 16 bytes
 * and is represented as a pair of <code>long</code> values.
 *
 * <p>This map responds to lookup with a <code>long</code> value representing the address of
 * the value block. The actual data must be accessed using <code>Unsafe</code> memory operations.
 * <b>The returned address is valid only up to the next map update operation</b>.
 *
 * <p>One recommended approach to a convenient usage of the returned address is to construct
 * a flyweight object around it and access the value's components through the object's API.
 *
 * <p>This map makes no assumptions about the key's semantics; it just uses them as the literal
 * 16 bytes of data. However, a major use case is where the key represents a "safe pointer" to
 * a native memory block. It consists of a pair <code>(nativeAddress, sequenceId)</code>, where
 * <code>nativeAddress</code> is the address of a native memory block containing key data and
 * <code>sequenceId</code> is a number unique to the particular allocation event of that memory block.
 * This avoids the "ABA problem": the block at <code>nativeAddress</code> could be deallocated, then
 * reallocated for another purpose. Then <code>nativeAddress</code> would represent a valid pointer
 * pointing to invalid data. The <code>(nativeAddress, sequenceId)</code> pair is expected to be
 * acquired from a native data structure which complies with this concept and stores the relevant
 * key data.

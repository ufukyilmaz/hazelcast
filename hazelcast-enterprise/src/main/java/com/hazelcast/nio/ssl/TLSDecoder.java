/**
 * A {@link com.hazelcast.internal.networking.OutboundHandler} responsible
 * for decoding TLS traffic.
 *
 * This TLSDecoder will decode to the application buffer and then it will get copied
 * to the dst buffer. Although this requires a useless copy, directly decoding to the
 * dst buffer has some serious implications. There is a very significant performance
 * drop for the SSLEngine if this is done.

 * Normally the dst ByteBuffer will be the buffer used for decoding, so no
 * intermediate copy of the data is needed as was the case in HZ 3.10 and older.
 *
 * But if the dst ByteBuffer is too small to decode, an intermediate 'appBuffer'
 * will be used for decoding purposes. So src->appBuffer->dst. This is a very
 * concrete problem with the ProtocolDecoder that only has a buffer of 3 bytes,
 * and will not be accepted by the SSLEngine for unwrapping even though there
 * might only 3 bytes to decode.
 *
 * The TLS decoder should have preferable a large src buffer; if this buffer is
 * used to read data from the socket, it should read as much data as possible without
 * needing to go to the socket again.
 *
 * However the dst buffer should not be a lot bigger than the packetBuffer size; because
 * we want to push the decoded bytes through the pipeline as fast as possible.
 *
 * Ideally the TLSDecoder would not be creating the src buffer; but the destination
 * buffer.

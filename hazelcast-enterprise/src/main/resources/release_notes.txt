==== 3.12 ====

1. Enhancements

Hazelcast IMDG Enterprise Enhancements:

* Sharing Hot Restart `base-dir` among Multiple Members: The base directory for the Hot Restart feature (`base-dir`) is now used as a shared directory between multiple members, and each member uses a unique sub-directory inside this base directory. This allows using the same configuration on all the members. Previously, each member had to use a separate directory which complicated the deployments on cloud-like environments. During the restart, a member tries to lock an already existing Hot Restart directory inside the base directory. If it cannot acquire any, then it creates a fresh new directory. See the Configuring Hot Restart section.
* Add/Remove WAN Publishers in a Running Cluster: Introduced the ability to dynamically add or remove WAN publishers (target clusters). See the Dynamically Adding WAN Publishers section.
* Automatic Removal of Stale Hot Restart Data: Introduced an option that allows the stale Hot Restart data to be removed automatically. See the description of the `auto-remove-stale-data` configuration element in the Configuring Hot Restart section.
* Client Permission Handling When a New Member Joins: Introduced a declarative configuration attribute `on-join-operation` for the client permission in the Security configuration (its programmatic configuration equivalent is the `setOnJoinPermissionOperation()` method). This attribute allows to choose whether a new member joining to a cluster will apply the client permissions stored in its own configuration, or will use the ones defined in the cluster. See the Handling Permissions When a New Member Joins section.

Hazelcast IMDG Open Source Enhancements:

* CP Subsystem: Implementing the https://raft.github.io/[Raft consensus algorithm], Hazelcast introduces its CP subsystem which runs within a Hazelcast cluster and offers linearizable implementations of Hazelcast's concurrency APIs. See the CP Subsystem chapter.
* Client Instance Names and Attributes: You can now retrieve the names of client instances on the member side. Moreover, client attributes have been introduced so that you can group your clients and/or perform special operations for specific clients. See the Defining Client Attributes section.

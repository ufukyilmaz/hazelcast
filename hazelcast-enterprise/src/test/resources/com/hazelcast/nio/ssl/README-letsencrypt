This directory contains key and a Let's Encrypt CA signed certificate for a hostname `member1.hazelcast-test.download`:

`privkey.pem`  : the private key for your certificate.
`privkey.enc.pem`: the private key encrypted using `PBE-SHA1-3DES` PKCS#5 v1.5 algorithm (password: hazelcast)
`fullchain.pem`: host cert + CA cert
`chain.pem`    : CA cert
`cert.pem`     : host cert
`letsencrypt.jks`: private key + cert chain imported to a JKS keystore (password: 123456)

The encrypted key was generated by a following command:

```
openssl pkcs8 -in privkey.pem -topk8 -v1 PBE-SHA1-3DES -out privkey.enc.pem -passout pass:hazelcast
```
